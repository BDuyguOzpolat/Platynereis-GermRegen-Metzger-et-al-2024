This repository contains all the codes and other documents related to the manuscript Metzger et al 2024. 

R CODES and ASSOCIATED SPREADSHEETS

Speadsheets (.csv files), associated R codes, and relevant figures are summarized in the word document called "Description of Supplementary csv Files" 


PROTOCOLS

1) Ã–zpolat Lab HCR protocol (with Bria Metzger and Dr. Ryan Null's changes to the original Choi et al 2018 protocol)


IMAGING DATA ORIGINAL TIFF FILES

We uploaded all the original files to Zenodo. 

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10836252 (40 Segment group) and 10.5281/zenodo.10838976 (60 Segment group) 

These samples were processed for vasa, usp, nanos (abbreviated as VUN). However, we only analyzed vasa expression for this publication because the other two probes did not generate consistent results for a technical reason we could not identify (both probes had worked fine in the past). Therefore we removed them from the analysis, but they are nevertheless a part of the z-stacks. 

The following combinations of amplifier and fluors were used: 
B1-vasa-647
B2-usp-546
B3-nanos-488
DAPI

Example file name and key: 
VUN-40-7DPA-W1_B1-vasa-647_B2-usp-546_B3-nanos-488_DAPI_40x_tilestack
VUN: vasa, usp, nanos
40: 40segment group
7DPA: 7 days post amputation
W1: Worm sample 1 on the slide 
40X: lense used
tilestack: it is a tiled z-stack 

The files can be opened with FIJI, and will still have metadata associated.
